Math/Radicals version 0.01
==========================

This Module is an interface to Mathamatic Radicals, also called Square Roots.
Here's how it works:
use Math::Radicals;
$radical = Math::Radicals;
$newVar = $radical->cube_root(54);
$newVar2 = $radical->simp(54,3);
print "$newVar is the cube root of 54. $newVar2 is it simplified";

The output is:
3.77976314968462 is the cube root of 54. 3 rad3(2) is it simplified  

FUNCTIONS
root(NUMBER[, ROOT_OF])
ex. root(100, 10);
will yield 1.58... which is the 10 root of 100 (1.58... to the power of 10). 
Without ROOT_OF function, it defaults to 2, square rooting (perl's sqrt function
will be faster for squaring.)

cube_root(NUMBER[, ROOT_OF])
ex. cube_root(54);
will yield 3.77... which is the cubic root of 54 (3.77... to the power of 3).
Same as root function, but will default to 3, cube rooting.

factors(NUMBER);
ex. factors(3)
In scalar context is the number of factors in NUMBER. In array it is a list of
numbers that are factors of NUMBER, from greatest to least.

simp(NUMBER[, ROOT_OF])
simp(54,3);
will yield a string, "3 rad3(2)" which means 3 times cubic radical (rad3) of 2. 
This will default to 2, for simplifing a square root. There is no number after
rad for simplifing a square root, but for everything else in ROOT_OF is will say
radROOT_OF.
